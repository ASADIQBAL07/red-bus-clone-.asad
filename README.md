# red-bus-clone-.asad
The RedBus Clone App is built with HTML &amp; CSS, offering UI for bus, train, and cab booking. It features a responsive search section, seat layout, and results pages. Though static, it demonstrates clean design, semantic markup, and responsive layouts, ideal for learning and portfolios.
# RedBus Clone (HTML & CSS)

A lightweight, responsive **RedBus clone** built using **pure HTML and CSS**.  
This project recreates the core look-and-feel of the RedBus landing and search pages — including the hero search bar, popular routes, offers, and a results listing layout — without any JS or backend. Perfect for beginners to practice semantic markup, layout systems, and responsive design.

## ✨ Features
- **Hero search section** with From/To, Date, and Search CTA (UI only)
- **Popular routes / offers** cards
- **Bus results listing layout** with operator name, timings, ratings, price (static)
- **Seat layout mockup** (CSS grid illustration; non-interactive)
- **Fully responsive** with mobile-first breakpoints
- **Reusable CSS utilities** for spacing, grid, and typography
- **Accessible semantics** (labels, alt text, proper headings)

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (semantic tags, accessible forms)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, custom properties/variables)
- No frameworks, no JS — intentionally simple.
